# 📊 Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a retail Superstore dataset to uncover key business insights related to **sales performance, profitability, discount strategy, and operational efficiency** across different regions, states, and product categories.

The goal of this analysis is not only to explore the data, but to translate findings into **actionable business recommendations** that can support better decision-making for pricing, product strategy, and regional performance management.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Perform structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
- Build interactive dashboards in Power BI
- Communicate insights through a professional business report
- Think analytically with a business mindset

## 🧠 Business Questions
The analysis seeks to answer the following questions:
1. Which product categories and subcategories drive profits and losses?
2. Which states and regions perform best and worst in terms of profitability?

## 📊 Key Insights
Some of the major insights uncovered include:

- Furniture generates high sales but remains the least profitable category (profit margin ≈ 2.49%).
- High sales do not guarantee profitability — states like Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois record large sales volumes but operate at losses.
- Discount shows a strong negative correlation with profit margin (-0.865), indicating that aggressive discounting erodes profitability.
- Losses are concentrated in specific combinations of region and product category, especially Furniture in the Central and Southern regions.
- Shipping mode and customer segment alone do not significantly drive profitability.
- Tables and Bookcases are the largest loss-driving subcategories, while Copiers, Phones, Accessories, and Paper are the top profit contributors.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

- Review pricing and cost structure of Furniture subcategories (especially Tables and Bookcases).
- Implement stricter discount control policies, particularly in underperforming regions.
- Investigate operational inefficiencies in high-loss states such as Texas and Ohio.
- Focus sales strategy on high-margin products like Copiers, Accessories, and Paper.
- Reevaluate shipping strategy for Machine subcategory under First Class shipping.
